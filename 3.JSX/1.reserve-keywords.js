/* 
There are some reserve keywords in every programming language that we can not use accroding
to our wish rather we must use them according to the strict rule of the language.

Examplae: for, while, switch, if, var, let, const, function, class. We can not use them every where. We can only use them for the specific task.

Similarly className is a reserve keyword of React.
